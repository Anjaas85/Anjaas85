# Hi, I'm Anja!

## Education

- *Bachelor degree* in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Mathematics (2020 - 2024)
- *Master's degree* in Computer Science at the Sapienza University of Rome, Faculty of Informational Engineering, Computer Science and Statistics (2024 - *Expected* 2026)
## Master's Projects

- [Spectrum Guided Model Merging](https://github.com/Anjaas85/Spectrum-Guided-Model-Merging): (In progress) This project compares full-model merging with selective merging of high signal-to-noise ratio layers for NLP tasks, using TIES and SLERP. The analysis evaluates performance, robustness, and task interference across benchmark datasets.
- [Few Shot Learning for Prototypical Networks on Sapienza campus dataset](https://github.com/Anjaas85/Protonet_FSL): This project explores few-shot learning with Prototypical Networks, focusing on metric-based classification under limited labeled data. Experiments are conducted on the Sapienza campus dataset, a custom dataset collected by the authors, evaluating performance across different N-way, K-shot settings.
- [Investigating Hallucinations in LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://github.com/Anjaas85/Hallucinations-Rag-vs-NoRag): This project studies hallucinations in LLMs by comparing a baseline T5-small with a retrieval-augmented (RAG) version using FAISS.
- [Graph Metanetworks and Unlearning](https://github.com/muradhuseynov1/Graph_Metanetworks_and_Unlearning): This project explores unlearning techniques for Vision Transformers and Graph MetaNetworks, focusing on methods to selectively remove learned information.
- [CIFER10 vs CIFAKE10](https://github.com/Anjaas85/CIFAR10_vs_CIFAKE): This project compares ResNet and DenseNet performance on CIFAR-10 and CIFAKE-10 datasets, analyzing model robustness and accuracy differences between real and synthetic image data.
## Bachelor's Projects

- [Compiler for Serbian-Pascal to Assembly](https://github.com/Anjaas85/serbscal): This project implements a compiler for a Serbian-language variant of Pascal, translating source code into executable assembly. The implementation includes a lexer, parser, and semantic actions using Flex, Yacc, and C++.
- [Charity Donation Android POS Application](https://github.com/tanjagavric/it.girls)): This project developed an Android POS application enabling customers to donate to charity while paying at the cash desk. The interface and database were implemented in Java, and the project won second prize at the Belgrade Payten Hackathon 2023.
- [Association Game in Kotlin](https://github.com/matf-pp/2023_Asocijacije): This project develops an association game with a fully implemented frontend, backend, and database using Kotlin.
